Special thanks to Cody Schafer(jmesmon) for providing some of the
fixes and to all the people out there packaging tcplay for their
distros! If there's any way that I can make your life easier, let
me know! Thanks to all the bug reporters as well.

 * Fixed edge case with memcpy copying in and out to the same place

 * Given up on -Werror, as some Linux distros have warnings even in
   their standard header files.
